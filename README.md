# The Gallery of Boykissers (AKA OWO's Secret Stash)

## WTF is this
Hi there! Recently I noticed a BUNCH of people were just posting entire GOOGLE DRIVES FILLED with boykisser memes & other related stuff. But it was all unsorted ( -.-)

So I decided to download it all, sorted it by file type.
I hope that in the future we can get tags and better credit artists etc - but there are a **LOT of images** and I just made this over the weekend soooo we'll see.

## ***For clarity sake I want to state that:***

I usually do **backend** dev stuff and random hobby projects. So I'm not the best at making things 𝓁𝑜𝑜𝓀 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝒹 (look good) and coding websites in general (I have had a tiny bit of practice before). So basically at the start of the project I did use ChatGPT to guide me on how things could look.

If you would like to see what ChatGPT's version looks like, view these files:
- `indexChatGPT.html` 
- `styleChatGPT.css`

So hopefully this clears things up, I'd say *most* of the code was created by me. 
And of course with the help by every coder's dream fiancé ₊✩‧₊ *stackoverflow* ₊✩‧₊

## Finally Notes

***NO IMAGES IN THIS WERE GENERATED WITH AI***  
<sup>(Unless one of the google drives included it by accident..)</sup>

***I also do not own any of the rights to these images***  
<sup>If you know some of the artists please feel free to submit a pull request renaming the files to include the author</sup>
