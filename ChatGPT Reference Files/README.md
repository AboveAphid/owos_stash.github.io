## ***For clarity sake I want to state that:***

I usually do **backend** dev stuff and random hobby projects. So I'm not the best at making things 𝓁𝑜𝑜𝓀 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝒹 (look good) and coding websites in general (I have had a tiny bit of practice before). So basically at the start of the project I did use ChatGPT to guide me on how things could look.

If you would like to see what ChatGPT's version looks like look at the files in this folder (`ChatGPT Reference Files`).

So hopefully this clears things up, I'd say *most* of the code was created by me. 
And of course with the help by every coder's dream fiancé ₊✩‧₊ *stackoverflow* ₊✩‧₊
